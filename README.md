## Conclusion

This notebook has been successfully completed, and I have shared my findings about a global skincare and beauty store through various charts. Some insights, however, are limited and cannot be fully displayed here due to my current skillset and technology constraints. Nevertheless, these insights have been addressed and are showcased in Power BI, where an interactive dashboard has been created to display the insights and key performance indicators (KPIs). Each visualization includes annotations to help viewers easily understand and interpret my findings.

Thanks for reading and attention!
